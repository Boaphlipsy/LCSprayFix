# LCSprayFix

(Hopefully) Fixes the bug of spray marks sometimes not getting removed when leaving the moon.  
This mod will just remove all spray marks after leaving a moon. Will also remove the spray marks in the ship or on players.

## Incompatibilities:
- [BetterSprayPaint](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/taffyko/BetterSprayPaint/) 
- Other Spray Paint Mods may or may not be compatible. You'll have to try that yourselves.

## Change notes:
### 1.0.4
- Added incompatibilities list to description

### 1.0.3
- Ok so the last version still didn't fix it, maybe it's fixed with this version? Sadly just really hard to test since it is such an inconsistent bug.

### 1.0.2 
- Now also removes the spray marks when the ship leaves automatically. Forgot to do that in previous patch  

### 1.0.1
- Hopefully actually fixed the issue  

### 1.0.0
- Initial Release
