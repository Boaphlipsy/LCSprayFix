# LCSprayFix

Fixes the bug of spray marks sometimes not getting removed when leaving the moon.  
This mod will just remove all spray marks after leaving a moon. Will also remove the spray marks in the ship.

## Changes:
### 1.0.3
- Ok so the last version still didn't fix it, maybe it's fixed with this version? Sadly just really hard to test since it is such an inconsistent bug.

### 1.0.2 
- Now also removes the spray marks when the ship leaves automatically. Forgot to do that in previous patch  

### 1.0.1
- Hopefully actually fixed the issue  

### 1.0.0
- Initial Release
