# LCSprayFix

Fixes the bug of spray marks sometimes not getting removed when leaving the moon.

This mod will just remove all spray marks after leaving a moon. Will also remove the spray marks in the ship.

## Changes:
### 1.0.2 
- Now also removes the spray marks when the ship leaves automatically<br>
  Forgot to do that in previous patch  

### 1.0.1
- Hopefully actually fixed the issue  

### 1.0.0
- Initial Release
